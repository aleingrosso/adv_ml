  * Master course at Radboud University - 6 EC
  * Teaching Assistants: [Mauricio Diaz-Ortiz](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/diaz-ortiz-jr-m), [David Ernstberger](david.ernstberger@ru.nl)

This [course](https://ru.osiris-student.nl/onderwijscatalogus/extern/cursus?taal=en&cursuscode=NWI-NM048B&collegejaar=2025) provides advanced topics in machine learning, with a particular focus on how the statistical physics of disordered systems helps in understanding learning and generalization abilities of neural networks. The course is intended for Master's students in physics and mathematics. This course is the follow-up of [CDS: Machine Learning](https://ru.osiris-student.nl/onderwijscatalogus/extern/cursus?taal=en&cursuscode=NWI-NM048D&collegejaar=2025).

## Main topics
* Monte Carlo methods and variational approximation for inference and learning
* Message passing algorithms
* Statistical physics of machine learning: replica method, phase transitions in learning and generalization
* Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks
* Infinite width limits in deep networks and theory of kernels
* Recurrent networks
* Modern Hopfield Networks, Attention, Transformers
